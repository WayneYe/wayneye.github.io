<p>Few days ago <a href="http://ln.hixie.ch/" target="_blank">Ian Hickson</a> wrote a blog: <a href="http://blog.whatwg.org/html-is-the-new-html5" target="_blank">HTML is the new HTML5</a>, he referred "<a href="http://lists.whatwg.org/pipermail/whatwg-whatwg.org/2009-December/024477.html" target="_blank">we moved to a new development model</a>", and comes with two major changes:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://whatwg.org/html">The HTML specification</a> will henceforth just be known as "HTML", with the URL <code>http://whatwg.org/html.</code></li>
	<li>The WHATWG HTML spec now became "<strong>living standard</strong>", "It's more mature than any version of the HTML specification". I took a screenshot below:</li>
</ol>

<p>In a simple sentence: HTML is going to "<strong>unversioned model</strong>", according to this there is definitely a concern: OK, living standard? Does this mean the standard could be changed/updated/revised at anytime? I saw one person asked posted this question and Ian Hickson replied, he emphasized WHATWG worked hard on backward-capability, and they worked tightly with browser vendors to make sure they do not change things that most people depend on, this is good and really important!</p>

<p>So, things is getting more and more interesting with HTML 5 (should I just call HTML?), few days<!--more--> before (18 January 2011) W3 just "unveiled" the HTML 5 logo: <a href="http://www.w3.org/News/2011#entry-8992">http://www.w3.org/News/2011#entry-8992</a>, I bet there could be more or less confusion:)</p>
