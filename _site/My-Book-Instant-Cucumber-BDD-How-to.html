<meta name="description" content="The background I received an email during November 2012 from Packt, in the email they asked me whether or not consider writing a book for them related with BDD using Cucumber based on Rails platform, the book will only contains 50-70 pages, they named this kind of book &quot;Instant book&quot;, usually it is a quick guide for beginners using some kinds of technologies. Well, my first reaction was: &quot;Wow, I even never thought about writing a book, if I am going to write one, hum... can I?&quot;, I did suspect myself a little bit, especially, the book will be written in English, I admitted I was not confident enough to reply them. Actually I could imagine how hard this would be for me, a rookie who would write his first book, and at that period I was about to finish my 6 months business trip in Xi&#39;an and would be back to ThoughtWorks Shanghai office soon, too many things... However, I am kind of person who always expects challenges, and always willing to improve and beyond myself! I decided to give it a try!">

          <h3>The background</h3>
<p>I received an email during November 2012 from <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/" target="_blank">Packt</a>, in the email they asked me whether or not consider writing a book for them related with BDD using Cucumber based on Rails platform, the book will only contains 50-70 pages, they named this kind of book "Instant book", usually it is a quick guide for beginners using some kinds of technologies. Well, my first reaction was: "Wow, I even never thought about writing a book, if I am going to write one, hum... can I?", I did suspect myself a little bit, especially, <strong>the book will be written in English</strong>, I admitted I was not confident enough to reply them.</p>
<p>Actually I could imagine how hard this would be for me, a rookie who would write his first book, and at that period I was about to finish my 6 months business trip in Xi'an and would be back to ThoughtWorks Shanghai office soon, too many things... However, I am kind of person who always expects challenges, and always willing to <strong>improve and beyond myself</strong>! I decided to give it a try!</p>

<h3>The process</h3>
<p>As soon as replied their email, the game kicked off, and I soon felt the pressure, Packt asked me to give them a skeleton of the book within three days, whereas 95% of my daily work was pair programming, and the rest 5% was meeting:) I had no choice but utilizing all my spare time, and I need my family's support, especially my son's support:)</p>
<p>I worked out a skeleton and sent to Packt in time, I decided to write this book with not only easy guidance and tutorials, but also with technical explanation in depth!</p>
<p>
  I decided to use my free <a href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> git repository to store my book, the drafted skeleton was submitted by me on <i>Dec 07 2012</i>, there had been many changes after the final publish, but this was really the first step!

Running the program again for the tests to pass
