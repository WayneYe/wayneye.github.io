<p>During the past few days I was studying <strong>Project Time Management</strong> in PMBOK, for preparing the upcoming PMP exam on 4th December 2010, while I spent a few hours on understanding/mastering EVM, I log my memory here<img style="background-image:url(http://wayneye.com/Images/winLiveEmotions.gif);background-position:-0px -0px;width:19px;height:19px;" alt="Smile" src="http://wayneye.com/Images/invis.gif"></p>

<p><strong>EVM</strong> stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_value_management">Eearned Value Management</a>, it is a complementary for <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method">Critical Path Method</a></strong> schedule management, its purpose could be described as “<strong>What did we get for the money we spent?”</strong> the definition of is in Wikipedia is below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Earned value management</b> (<b>EVM</b>) is a <a href="https://mail.google.com/wiki/Project_management">project management</a> technique for measuring project progress in an objective manner. EVM has the ability to combine measurements of scope, schedule, and cost in a single integrated system. When properly applied, EVM provides an early warning of performance problems. Additionally, EVM promises to improve the definition of <a href="https://mail.google.com/wiki/Scope_(project_management)">project scope</a>, prevent <a href="https://mail.google.com/wiki/Scope_creep">scope creep</a>, communicate objective progress to <a href="https://mail.google.com/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)">stakeholders</a>, and keep the <a href="https://mail.google.com/wiki/Project_team">project team</a> focused on achieving progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are three fundamental glossaries in EVM, they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>PV</strong> Plan Value (also called <strong>BCWS</strong> – Badget Cost for Work Scheduled) </li>

  <li><strong>AC </strong>Actual Cost (also called <strong>ACWP</strong> – Actual Cost for Work Performed) </li>

  <li><strong>EV</strong> Earned Value (also called <strong>BCWP </strong>Badget Cost for Worked Performed), so 

    <br />EV = BAC (Budget At Completion) * [Finished work]% 

    <br />EV formula from Wikipedia: </li>
</ul>

<p><img style="background-color: white;background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="EV" border="0" alt="EV" src="http://wayneye.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/ev_thumb.png?w=240&amp;h=59" width="240" height="59" /></p>

<p>For simple and straight-forward, in my understanding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PV is on a specified timestamp, what is the planed budget. </li>

  <li>AC is on a specified timestamp, what is the actual cost. </li>

  <li>EV is on a specified timestamp, how much percent of work has been done while how much cost was expected. </li>
</ul>

<ul>During the project implementing process, Program Manager tracks the schedule and cost using EVM, and calculate SV&amp;SV, SPI&amp;CPI, they are:</ul>

<p><strong>SV</strong> Schedule Variance </p>

  <p>SV = EV – PV </p>

  <p><strong>CV </strong>Cost Variance </p>

  <p>CV = EV – AC</p>
<br />
<p><strong>SPI</strong> Schedule Performance Index  </p>

  <p>SPI = EV/PV </p>

  <p><strong>CPI</strong> Cost Performance Index </p>

  <p>CPI = EV/CV</p>

<p>I take a simple example for better understanding, assume I am managing a <strong>10 days</strong> project code name “<strong>Lambda</strong>”, Lambda project has a BAC of <strong>$100</strong>, and the detailed project schedule was determined below:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="400"><tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" width="36">Day#</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">1</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">2</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">3</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">4</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">5</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">6</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">7</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">8</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">9</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">10</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td valign="top" width="36">Budget</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>

<p>The scenario is at the end of day 3, I (PM) called up team member and held a meeting to track status, we found:</p>

<p>We got<strong> 40%</strong> of the entire work done, on the other hand, we’ve already spent $60, based on this fact, I (PM) will get to know:</p>

<p>PV: 3 days past, initially we planed/supposed to spend $30 according to the schedule, so PV=30. </p>
<p>AC: We’ve spent &amp;60, so AC=60. </p>

<p>EV: we finished 40% of work, initially we planed/supposed to spend $40 to get 40% work done, so EV=40</p>

<p>OK, then:</p>

<p>SV = EV – PV = 40 – 30 = 10, <strong>greater than 0, it is good, we are ahead schedule</strong><img style="background-image:url(http://wayneye.com/Images/winLiveEmotions.gif);background-position:-0px -0px;width:19px;height:19px;" alt="Smile" src="http://wayneye.com/Images/invis.gif"></p>

<p>CV = EV- CV = 40 – 60 = -20,<strong> smaller than 0, it is not good, we are overspending money</strong><img style="background-image:url(http://wayneye.com/Images/winLiveEmotions.gif);background-position:-171px -0px;width:19px;height:19px;" alt="Smile" src="http://wayneye.com/Images/invis.gif" /></p>

<p>SPI = EV/PV = 40/30 = 1.3 &gt; 1 greater than 1, good. 
  <br />CPI = EV/CV = 40/60 = 0.66 &lt; 1, smaller than 1, not good.</p>

<p>+U+U to myself, I put a flag here, I believe I will pass the exam!</p>
