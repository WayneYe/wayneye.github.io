<p>Three months ago, my article <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/HTML/Web-Socket-in-Essence.aspx" target="_blank">&lt;HTML5 WebSocket In Essence&gt;</a> was honored to be named first prize in <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/Awards/Winners.aspx?obtid=2&amp;cmpTpId=3&amp;cid=494" target="_blank">CodeProject HTML5 &amp; CSS3 competion</a>, the award was an Ipad2. To be very honest I was expecting to win a T-Shirt or a CP Mug, if I could get either on I would be really excited, so when I received the email congratulating me I was the winner, you can image how excited and happy I was at that time<img style="background-image: url('http://wayneye.com/Images/winLiveEmotions.gif'); background-position: -0px -0px; width: 19px; height: 19px;" src="http://wayneye.com/Images/invis.gif" alt="Smile" />.</p>
<p>However, the editor from CodeProject told me they were unable to ship the Ipad2 to China, they could give me equivalent money - $499.99, however after a very short consideration I decided to take the Ipad, absolutely!</p>
<p>So eventually, today, thanks to my co-workers in Cupertino, I got it, below are photos taken from my Sentation:</p>

<p>There is another "award" in fact, now if I google with keywords: &ldquo;<strong>html5 websocket</strong>&rdquo;, my article appears second result<img style="background-image: url('http://wayneye.com/Images/winLiveEmotions.gif'); background-position: -0px -0px; width: 19px; height: 19px;" src="http://wayneye.com/Images/invis.gif" alt="Smile" />.</p>
