<h2 id="the-motivation">The motivation</h2>

<p>In June 2018, PacktPub contacted me and asked my interest for recording a video course, they provided a few topics like AWS, Python, Docker, etc, I knew it could be very challenging but also pretty cool thing to do, so I accepted their invitation without hesitation.</p>

<h2 id="my-journey">My journey</h2>
<p>Nothing begins easily, I actually struggled quite a few weeks on the audio quality.  My collaborator <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ranjita-panda-85737b12b/">Ranjitap Panda</a> suggested me to buy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-Microphone-Brushed-Aluminum/dp/B002OO333Q/ref=sr_1_7?crid=MFDYMJ898LW7&amp;keywords=blue+microphone&amp;qid=1558027821&amp;s=gateway&amp;sprefix=blue+micro%2Caps%2C197&amp;sr=8-7">this Microphone</a>, I did and it was quite decent, however, my working room isn’t quite soundproof, so she suggested me to buy something like <a href="https://express.google.com/u/0/product/14999533088633590141_483183884403381036_5916206?utm_source=google_shopping&amp;utm_medium=tu_prop&amp;utm_content=eid-lsjeuxoeqt&amp;gtim=CPCPwdrs3baPKhD67br-_fi4isQBGPCz2hkiA1VTRCiQ-cHnBTCujOkC&amp;utm_campaign=5916206&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwlPTmBRBoEiwAHqpvhR80piK0OZcxPrMsLaqS39LvCaCDl9RBX4S9SwsibW1LTSZKIm6B1hoCpr8QAvD_BwE">this</a> to improve the quality, well, I looked at it and I wasn’t that convinced by its effectiveness <img class="emoji" title=":sweat_smile:" alt=":sweat_smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f605.png" height="20" width="20">.</p>

<p>I decided to DIY a super professional “recording studio”, it wasn’t so hard after 2 days of hand making:

    <a href="/assets/images/posts/2019-05-08-Master-AWS-Development-Published/Studio-1.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/posts/2019-05-08-Master-AWS-Development-Published/Studio-1.jpg"></a>

    <figcaption>DIYed super proffessional personal audio recording studio ^_^</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So just a moving box and a few pieces of <a href="https://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?id=586105899658&amp;ali_refid=a3_430620_1006:1196010016:N:z0OShXcL+rtIFJcT4Z2izQ==:a642190c156466fd7c802c60481c7916&amp;ali_trackid=1_a642190c156466fd7c802c60481c7916&amp;spm=a230r.1.14.3&amp;skuId=415859080730">this stuff from Taobao</a>, pretty cool, isn’t it <img class="emoji" title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20">, but most important, it is <strong>free and fun</strong>!!</p>

<p>After the initial back and force, I started recording video courses, and I soon realized this was much harder than I originally expected, usually I needed spending <strong>6-10 raw working hours</strong> to prepare one video course, and then spent another half an hour to record it, I wasn’t too much concerned about my Chinglish accent (there are many videos courses recorded by Indian English, Japanese English, etc), my accent might be the worst but this shouldn’t stop me from trying <img class="emoji" title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20">  Those raw working hours was invested on the following aspects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Video structure and outline (&lt;10%)</li>
  <li>Knowledge recap and investigate (10%)</li>
  <li>Content of narration (%60-%80)</li>
  <li>Environment and demo preparation (10%)</li>
  <li>Slides (&lt;10%)</li>
</ol>

<p>The journey was really challenging, besides, I was having a true tough time during the second half of year 2018, this significantly impacted my outcome for this video course, I actually seriously thought about giving up, for quite several times, but eventually I managed and survived<img class="emoji" title=":sun_with_face:" alt=":sun_with_face:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f31e.png" height="20" width="20">.</p>

<p>Hitting year 2019, I was doing better, faster and I believe the quality of video was becoming better IMHO, eventually I completed all the video and submitted the assessment during early Apr, 2019, I felt thankful, and indeed, exhausted.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thank you very much for your valuable time in reading this blog post, please check out <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/mastering-aws-development-video" target="_blank">Packt Website</a> to view and share this video course, appreciate your support <img class="emoji" title=":purple_heart:" alt=":purple_heart:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f49c.png" height="20" width="20">!
As usually, I would like to say my favorite words after a major milestone: <strong>this is not an end, this is yet another starting point towards a better future!</strong></p>

I bought a 2015 BMW X5 Dec last year, it has been half a year so far (with 2 months she stayed inside the garage for most of the time due to the pandemic), I am pretty satisfied with it, her condition is absolutely excellent, everything works, yes you see it correctly, after 5 years of its life, there was nothing broken, as BMW vehicle built in recent years, this is something not VERY easy.  My plan is to keep it as long as possible before it turns into an endless money pit, and keeping her value as high as possible, one of the major reason I b...</p>

  WHEN YOU ARE OLD



  When you are old and grey and full of sleep, 
And nodding by the fire, take down this book, 
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look 
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep; 
How many loved your moments of glad grace, 
And loved your beauty with love false or true, 
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, 
And loved the sorrows of your changing face; 
And bending down beside the glowing bars, 
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled 
And paced upon the mountains overhead 
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars. 
– By William Butler Yeats
