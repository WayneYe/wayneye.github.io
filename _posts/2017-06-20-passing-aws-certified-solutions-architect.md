3 years of AWS hands on experience, two months of preparation, 30 hours of course learning, 300+ exam practices, this was the work I've done to pass the **AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate**, my exam result is below:
<!--more-->

> Overall Score: 81%  
>   
> Topic Level Scoring:  
> 1.0 Designing highly available, cost efficient, fault tolerant, scalable systems: 81%  
> 2.0 Implementation/Deployment: 83%  
> 3.0 Security: 72%  
> 4.0 Troubleshooting: 100%

Frankly speaking, it was below my own expectation (> 90%), I wish I can do better two years later ^_^.


My tips and experience are summarized below:


1.  *Solid* understanding on these fundamental pillar services: IAM, EC2, S3, RDS and VPC, I feel these covered more than 60% of the quiz (just a rough number IMHO, correct me if i am wrong).
2.  Good overall understanding on CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Route53, SQS, SWF, Storage Gateway, CloudFront, doing practice exam and reading their FAQs would be sufficient.
3.  #1 + #2 above should've secure 80%+, spend 80% of your exam preparation on them should be a right strategy to pass the final exam. However, please do not assume you can smash every single question which belongs to #1+#2, questions *can* be really tricky (even Ryan couldn't make it 100% ^_^)
4.  For some numbers/limits that may come up in the exam, but they are not easy to remember and very easy to got messed up, you can list them on a small paper, read them 5 minutes before getting into the final exam, I posted mine below FYI:) 


Note:  I wouldn't bother referring any detailed knowledge points for #1/#2 above or other services like Kinesis, SNS, Server Migration service, etc because Ryan had done an outstanding job in his course, thank you, Ryan! Hat off to you!

I shared my learning notes and small paper for "last-5-minutes quick catching" before starting, hope it can help you a little bit:
