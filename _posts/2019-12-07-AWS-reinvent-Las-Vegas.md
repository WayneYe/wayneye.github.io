This is my second time attending AWS re-Invent, last time was year 2017, the purpose of this blog is to summarize what I've learned, impressed and entertained :smile:

Overall during my week staying my daily schedule was listening to sessions mixed with slack/emails during the daylight, and party/social in the evening time.

All the keynotes/sessions have been uploaded here: [ https://reinvent.awsevents.com/learn/keynotes/ ](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/learn/keynotes/) and all announcements were summarized [at this page](https://aws.amazon.com/?sc_channel=em&sc_campaign=re:Invent%20Recaps%202019&sc_medium=em_212626&sc_content=launch_t1launch_reinvent&sc_geo=mult&sc_country=global&sc_outcome=launch&trk=em_212626&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTXpnME4ySTBOREZtWkRFMyIsInQiOiJHU0J5UndVeHBhZFJvc1g5SG5EYzhYeGpkNjhCUldkTXpwXC91TlExc1BPTDhBdmlyMCsyVjVwZmZmOHVuUFVqNTduSTR2Y1hreHpoQW9jMDJWaXUxeCtGbFNxSW5IZmRoUUs1U3RaQVwvdjA1U0x4RVJJQU9TZFZNSDFuS0VnVFFUdmRWMXVHSnFVakpWamRwcmRieFpxQT09In0%3D#Explore_Announcements), my personal top 5 thrilled announcements are:

1. [Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/): Quantum computing is seriously coming!
2. [Deep Composor](https://aws.amazon.com/deepcomposer): machine learning (and AI) is already mainstream technology, AWS will never wanna be out of this game, so they announced this [a machine learning-enabled musical keyboard for developers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YGZ4V5B), would that be a game changer?  Let's see!
3. The [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/): no doubt I will try it out and *very* possible I will be favoring it over terraform/CloudFormation.
4. [Amazon Buildersâ€™ Library](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library): Amazon's official best practices, white papers on arhcitecting/developing on the AWS Cloud Platform.
5. [Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/outposts): won't have any impact for developers, DevOps engineers or architects who work on AWS at daily basis, but could expand AWS business to even broader regions/countries, pretty ambitious!

All the session videos have been uploaded to: https://reinventvideos.com/, well done and very necessary, too!  [With more than 60,000 attendees this year](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/aws-reinvent-2019-telco-industry-guide/) I am pretty sure not even one attendee was able to listen to all the sessions and have to made some trade offs, so this is our go to place to watch the ones we had missed or even overlooked.

My focus areas are: general architecting, best practices, security, Serverless, containers, databases and chaos engineering practices, list below are the sessions I watched:

* [Best practices for Amazon S3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_3IaOVcIO0)
* [AWS re:Invent 2019: Performing chaos engineering in a serverless world (CMY301)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbyjpMeYitA)
* [Deep dive into AWS Cloud Development Kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9As_ZIjUGmY)
* [Running Kubernetes at Amazon scale using Amazon EKS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-Fh0OzliJI)
* [What's New in Amazon Aurora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WG01wJIGSQ)

In order to attend, I needed applying Ireland VISA, and since I was planning to fly back to Shanghai later in June, so I thought I could just fly from SF to Dublin, then Dublin to Shanghai, and soon I realized that there is no direct flight from DUB to PVG, so a practical (and also very fun and economic) option is to fly from Dublin to London, and then London to Shanghai, bingo ^_^

## The VISA application experience

The most appropriate VISA for me would be [Visitor in Transit VISA](https://www.gov.uk/transit-visa/visitor-in-transit-visa), which means I must have in/out flights and must leave UK within 48 hours, sounds good, I can stay in London two days, two nights, and since it was just 1 month away, I thought applying this kind of VISA would be relatively faster and easier.

So the first step is to make an appointment at USCIS and process 10 finger printings, short say: *10-printed*, it was not that bad since the most close USCIS office is just 15 minutes of walking from Autodesk 1 Market office.  After doing this I got a receipt and instructions which guides me the next step: mail all the required documents to UK Consulate in New Your: a letter to explain the purpose of the visit, financial proof and all my family members' profile, and most important: I must mail them my passport, inside this instruction it clearly instruct appliers to buy a shipping label from a VFS global: https://www.vfsglobal.co.uk/us/en/premium-services:

Well, I won't spend even 410 bucks to buy their "Premium Service", there is a section in the bottom of the page "Most popular services", and I chose "Round Trip Courier Service - up to 2lbs" which is 72 bucks (later on after I read some posts in Quora I realized this is not required, I can simply just purchase a return label from UPS).

So since I have to mail my passport and I would also apply Ireland VISA, and I visited the Ireland consulate and talked to a really nice lady officer there, explained my situation and she told me it is ok, they will process my VISA application without holding my passport, I can go ahead mail my passport to UK consulate, I appreciated her considerate.

I mailed my passport on May 23rd, i.e. 20 days before the tournament, I truly hoped my application can be processed fast enough.  However, the fact was there was no progress after two weeks, on Jun 5th I couldn't wait any longer, and I realized there isn't an online portal to track the VISA status nor a phone number to call, I called the UK consulate in San Francisco and the stuff was really rude and kept emphasizing they are not responsible for any VISA service, and I was redirected to a robot audio saying I can visit their website for contacting method.

After some googling and struggling I found their contact methods at: https://www.gov.uk/contact-ukvi-inside-outside-uk/y/outside-the-uk/english
> Contact UK Visas and Immigration in English

I called this number and the very first voice I heard was to enter my credit card information, and after 2 minutes of wait a human picked up the phone and stating immediately without even letting me to say hello: "before you talk please allow us to emphasize the disclaimer blah, blah...", this last about 40 seconds, and I finally got chance to speak, after explaining my situation I begged: "**please mail back me my passport immediately, I don't need VISA any more, thank you!!**".  I don't want to recap these horrible moments, I ended up by calling them twice and got charged `$1.75 * 2 + $15.68 + $29.68 = $48.86` for a single purpose as I roared above^.

## Conclusion
First, don't get me wrong, I fully respect UK, a great country that contributed a ton to humane being, I have several friends from UK as well.  However, IMHO, **visitor who plan travel to a certain place because they are expecting a pleasant journey, they hope a wonderful trip so that it can be shared to their friends and relatives, also to create some unforgettable memory**, whereas after experiencing this unpleasant, not friendly, or let me say it directly: arrogant VISA processing process: 10-printed + super detailed forms + non-traceable progress + insanely expensive inquiry phone charge VISA experience, this could kill all of their positive passion.  For my case please remember: after all I was just applying a Visitor in Transit VISA which only allowing me to stay in this country for **less than 48 hours**, but it almost destroyed my entire travel plan because of their "impressive efficiency"ðŸ˜
