<p>Per project needs we need print part of a web page, which I have no idea when I saw this requirement,&nbsp;I googled and I read this post:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.huntingground.freeserve.co.uk/main/mainfram.htm?../scripts/printing.htm">http://www.huntingground.freeserve.co.uk/main/mainfram.htm?../scripts/printing.htm</a>, it basically use <code>document.write</code> to write the content you want to print to a new window by <code>window.open</code>, it works, however I really don't like the opened window.</p>
<p>Occasionally&nbsp;I tried to find out whether CSS can achieve such function, seemed I was on the right way: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/media.html" target="_blank">CSS media types</a> is to control different display settings on different "media", controled completely by your own. What a shame to myself! CSS media types definiton from W3C official page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>One of the most important features of style sheets is that they specify how a document is to be presented on different media: on the screen, on paper, with a speech synthesizer, with a braille device, etc.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can define print style by few ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a seperate css file to define print style and link it by specifying <code>media=print</code>, &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="print.css" media="print" /&gt;</li>
<li>Insert a &lt;style media="print"&gt; snippet into the &lt;head&gt;.</li>
<li>Define <code>@media print</code> rule inline with our CSS code: <code>@media print {#text_print:display:visible;}</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd reccomended option 1 or 3 if the project is small.</p>
<p>In additional I occasionally found that the&nbsp;Web Development extetion for Chrome already support this, we don't have to waste many pieces of papers<img style="background-image: url('http://wayneye.com/Images/winLiveEmotions.gif'); background-position: -0px -0px; width: 19px; height: 19px;" src="http://wayneye.com/Images/invis.gif" alt="Smile" />.</p>
