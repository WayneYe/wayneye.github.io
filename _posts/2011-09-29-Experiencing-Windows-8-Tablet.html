<p>This week is a <strong>Tablet week</strong> for me, <a href="http://reyaandrithik.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Shilpa</a> told me the Ipad2 I won in the <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/Awards/Winners.aspx?obtid=2&amp;cmpTpId=3&amp;cid=494" target="_blank">Codeproject HTML5 &amp; CSS3 competition</a> had just arrived at Cupertino office, and my boss notified me he had successfully helped me bought an <strong>HP Touchpad</strong> - $99, &nbsp;and my colleague <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/" target="_blank">Jun Yi</a> participated <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/" target="_blank">Winndows Builld event</a> hosted on Sep 13th in Anaheim, CA, no doubt, he got a free <strong>Windows 8 Tablet</strong>, I envy him, absolutely; however this afternoon, he kindly borrowed it to me for the entire China National Day, I appreciate him<img style="background-image: url('http://wayneye.com/Images/winLiveEmotions.gif'); background-position: -0px -0px; width: 19px; height: 19px;" src="http://wayneye.com/Images/invis.gif" alt="Smile" />.</p>
<p>My Ipad2 and HP Touchpad will be brought by Mr.X who will visit Shanghai office recently, I am extremely excited about the Windows 8 Tablet, actually before I got it I've already borrowed an HP TouchSmart PC and installed Windows 8 Developer Preview, I even developed an "Hello World" Metro style app<img style="background-image: url('http://wayneye.com/Images/winLiveEmotions.gif'); background-position: -0px -0px; width: 19px; height: 19px;" src="http://wayneye.com/Images/invis.gif" alt="Smile" />.</p>
<p>Well one thing I wanna mention is during my way home, it rained heavily, since I was riding my bike the Tablet is exposed in the rain, so I unfixed my T-Shirt and covered it without&nbsp;hesitation! That's what a real geek should do, isn't it? By doing this I got a lot of doubtful look because I was barebacked^_^</p>
<p>No more words, enjoy my photos!</p>
