title: Storage+Media home server for less than $300
---

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I have been researched and watched many NAS options to setup a home storage+media server during the past year, and so far there was no perfect answer, either lacking features/performance, or way too expensive... An Intel Celeron CPU + 1GB mem with a customized Linux (in other words: closed source )running Plex or something else, and the cost is like $400 (terrible hardware performance), or $800+/$1000+, way too expensive, examples:</p>

<p>I didn't miss awesome <a href="http://www.freenas.org/" target="_blank">Free NAS</a>, but the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FreeNAS-Mini-Network-Attached-Diskless/dp/B00EQJ1BTU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1490657211&amp;sr=8-2-spons&amp;keywords=network+attached+storage&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">hardware</a> to run it costs $999,
 OMG...</p>
            
<h3>The $2XX solution</h3>
<p>I bought this just right Dell Poweredge T20 for $267, it has 
an Intel Pentium G3220 3.0GHz CPU, 4GB memory and 1TB hard drive, much more powerful than 90% NAS machines, and with 1TB drive built-in, which saves approximate another $50, i installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS on it,
so that it has tons of customizing ways and I can do all sorts of crazy things on it :) By installing the awesome <a href="https://emby.media/" target="_blank">Emby Media Server</a>, my home thearter finished with last piece, all my movies/videos/photos got stored inside it, I configured it to be auto wake/sleep by adding the following line into crontab:</p>
<p><code>0 22 * * * rtcwake -m disk -s 39600</code></p>
