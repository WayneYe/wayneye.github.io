<p>3 years of AWS hands on experience, two months of preparation, 30 hours of course learning, 300+ exam practices, this was the work I've done to pass the&nbsp;<strong>AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate</strong>, my exam result is below:</p>
<blockquote>Overall Score: 81%<br /><br />Topic Level Scoring:<br />1.0 Designing highly available, cost efficient, fault tolerant, scalable systems: 81%<br />2.0 Implementation/Deployment: 83%<br />3.0 Security: 72%<br />4.0 Troubleshooting: 100%</blockquote>

<div>Frankly speaking, it was below my own expectation (&gt; 90%), I wish I can do better two years later ^_^.</div>
<div>My tips and experience are summarized below:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>*Solid* understanding on these fundamental pillar services: IAM, EC2, S3,&nbsp;RDS&nbsp;and&nbsp;VPC, I feel these covered more than 60% of the quiz (just a rough number IMHO, correct me if&nbsp;i&nbsp;am wrong).</li>
<li>Good overall understanding on CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Route53, SQS, SWF, Storage Gateway, CloudFront, doing practice exam and reading their FAQs would be sufficient.</li>
<li>#1 + #2 above should've secure 80%+, spend 80% of your exam preparation on them should be a right strategy to pass the final exam. However, please do not assume you can smash every single question which belongs to #1+#2, questions *can* be really tricky (even Ryan couldn't make it 100% ^_^)</li>
<li>For some numbers/limits that may come up in the exam, but they are not easy to remember and very easy to got messed up, you can list them on a small paper, read them 5 minutes before getting into the final exam, I posted mine below FYI:)&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<div>Note: &nbsp;I wouldn't bother referring any detailed knowledge points for #1/#2 above or other services like Kinesis, SNS, Server Migration service, etc because Ryan had done an outstanding job in his course, thank you, Ryan! Hat off to you!</div>

<div>I shared my learning notes and small paper for "last-5-minutes quick catching" before starting, hope it can help you a little bit:</div>
