        <p>During the past few days I was studying <strong>Project Time Management</strong> in PMBOK, for preparing the upcoming PMP exam on 4th December 2010, while I spent a few hours on understanding/mastering EVM, I log my memory here<img style="background-image:url(http://wayneye.com/Images/winLiveEmotions.gif);background-position:-0px -0px;width:19px;height:19px;" alt="Smile" src="http://wayneye.com/Images/invis.gif"></p>

<p><strong>EVM</strong> stands for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_value_management">Eearned Value Management</a>, it is a complementary for <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method">Critical Path Method</a></strong> schedule management, its purpose could be described as “<strong>What did we get for the money we spent?”</strong> the definition of is in Wikipedia is below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><b>Earned value management</b> (<b>EVM</b>) is a <a href="https://mail.google.com/wiki/Project_management">project management</a> technique for measuring project progress in an objective manner. EVM has the ability to combine measurements of scope, schedule, and cost in a single integrated system. When properly applied, EVM provides an early warning of performance problems. Additionally, EVM promises to improve the definition of <a href="https://mail.google.com/wiki/Scope_(project_management)">project scope</a>, prevent <a href="https://mail.google.com/wiki/Scope_creep">scope creep</a>, communicate objective progress to <a href="https://mail.google.com/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)">stakeholders</a>, and keep the <a href="https://mail.google.com/wiki/Project_team">project team</a> focused on achieving progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are three fundamental glossaries in EVM, they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>PV</strong> Plan Value (also called <strong>BCWS</strong> – Badget Cost for Work Scheduled) </li>

  <li><strong>AC </strong>Actual Cost (also called <strong>ACWP</strong> – Actual Cost for Work Performed) </li>

  <li><strong>EV</strong> Earned Value (also called <strong>BCWP </strong>Badget Cost for Worked Performed), so 

    <br />EV = BAC (Budget At Completion) * [Finished work]% 

    <br />EV formula from Wikipedia: </li>
</ul>

<p><img style="background-color: white;background-image: none; border-right-width: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="EV" border="0" alt="EV" src="http://wayneye.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/ev_thumb.png?w=240&amp;h=59" width="240" height="59" /></p>

<p>For simple and straight-forward, in my understanding:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PV is on a specified timestamp, what is the planed budget. </li>

  <li>AC is on a specified timestamp, what is the actual cost. </li>

  <li>EV is on a specified timestamp, how much percent of work has been done while how much cost was expected. </li>
</ul>

<ul>During the project implementing process, Program Manager tracks the schedule and cost using EVM, and calculate SV&amp;SV, SPI&amp;CPI, they are:</ul>

<p><strong>SV</strong> Schedule Variance </p>

  <p>SV = EV – PV </p>

  <p><strong>CV </strong>Cost Variance </p>

  <p>CV = EV – AC</p>
<br />
<p><strong>SPI</strong> Schedule Performance Index  </p>

  <p>SPI = EV/PV </p>

  <p><strong>CPI</strong> Cost Performance Index </p>

  <p>CPI = EV/CV</p>

<p>I take a simple example for better understanding, assume I am managing a <strong>10 days</strong> project code name “<strong>Lambda</strong>”, Lambda project has a BAC of <strong>$100</strong>, and the detailed project schedule was determined below:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="400"><tbody>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top" width="36">Day#</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">1</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">2</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">3</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">4</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">5</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">6</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">7</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">8</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">9</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">10</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td valign="top" width="36">Budget</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>

      <td valign="top" width="36">$10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody></table>

<p>The scenario is at the end of day 3, I (PM) called up team member and held a meeting to track status, we found:</p>

<p>We got<strong> 40%</strong> of the entire work done, on the other hand, we’ve already spent $60, based on this fact, I (PM) will get to know:</p>

<p>PV: 3 days past, initially we planed/supposed to spend $30 according to the schedule, so PV=30. </p>
<p>AC: We’ve spent &amp;60, so AC=60. </p>

<p>EV: we finished 40% of work, initially we planed/supposed to spend $40 to get 40% work done, so EV=40</p>

<p>OK, then:</p>

<p>SV = EV – PV = 40 – 30 = 10, <strong>greater than 0, it is good, we are ahead schedule</strong><img style="background-image:url(http://wayneye.com/Images/winLiveEmotions.gif);background-position:-0px -0px;width:19px;height:19px;" alt="Smile" src="http://wayneye.com/Images/invis.gif"></p>

<p>CV = EV- CV = 40 – 60 = -20,<strong> smaller than 0, it is not good, we are overspending money</strong><img style="background-image:url(http://wayneye.com/Images/winLiveEmotions.gif);background-position:-171px -0px;width:19px;height:19px;" alt="Smile" src="http://wayneye.com/Images/invis.gif" /></p>

<p>SPI = EV/PV = 40/30 = 1.3 &gt; 1 greater than 1, good. 
  <br />CPI = EV/CV = 40/60 = 0.66 &lt; 1, smaller than 1, not good.</p>

<p>+U+U to myself, I put a flag here, I believe I will pass the exam!</p>

  WHEN YOU ARE OLD



  When you are old and grey and full of sleep, 
And nodding by the fire, take down this book, 
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look 
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep; 
How many loved your moments of glad grace, 
And loved your beauty with love false or true, 
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, 
And loved the sorrows of your changing face; 
And bending down beside the glowing bars, 
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled 
And paced upon the mountains overhead 
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars. 
– By William Butler Yeats

I was planning to attend #adskfootball2019 in Dublin, Ireland from Jun 14th to Jun 16th, 2019:

    
    Autodesk Football Tournament 2019


In order to attend, I needed applying Ireland VISA, and since I was planning to fly back to Shanghai later in June, so I thought I could just fly from SF to Dublin, then Dublin to Shanghai, and soon I realized that there is no direct flight from DUB to PVG, so a practical (and also very fun and economic) option is to fly from Dublin to London, and then London to Shanghai, bingo ^_^
