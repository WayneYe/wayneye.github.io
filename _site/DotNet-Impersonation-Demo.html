  <p>I read many articles and blogs and wrote an <strong>ImpersonateHelper</strong> class to do impersonation work, during the investigating I noticed that very few articles/blogs refer a complete impersonation process, so I decided to write one that refer as more details as I can, and actually my code was a code snippet combination came from 10+ sources<img style="background-image:url(http://wayneye.com/Images/winLiveEmotions.gif);background-position:-0px -0px;width:19px;height:19px;" alt="Smile" src="http://wayneye.com/Images/invis.gif" />.</p>

  <h3>Functionality</h3>

  <p>I create a local user: <strong>TempUser</strong> which belongs to “Administrators” (make sure log on TempUser at least once), I logged on as my own account and I am going to impersonate <strong>TempUser</strong> and do two things:</p>
<!--more-->
  <ol>
    <li>Create a folder “C:\TempFolder”, modify its default privilege, ONLY <strong>TempUser</strong> has full control of it, I will create a text file under this folder after impersonating to <strong>prove impersonation is successfully</strong>. </li>

      <br /><img title="Tempfolder1" border="0" alt="Tempfolder1" src="http://wayneye.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/tempfolder1_thumb.png?w=527&amp;h=543" width="527" height="543" /> 

      <p><strong>Notes</strong>: After setting <strong>TempUser</strong> as the only owner, my current account cannot access this folder except privilege promotion (I disabled UAC, if UAC is enabled, a prompt window will pop up and as for Admin confirm). 

        <br />

        <br /><img title="Tempfolder2" border="0" alt="Tempfolder2" src="http://wayneye.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/tempfolder2_thumb.png?w=370&amp;h=195" width="370" height="195" /></p>

      <p>In additional, I tried to access this folder programmatically <strong>under my account</strong>, <strong>UnauthorizedAccessException</strong>will be thrown! 

        <br />

        <br /><img title="Unauthorized" border="0" alt="Unauthorized" src="http://wayneye.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/unauthorized_thumb.png?w=495&amp;h=319" width="495" height="319" /></p>

    <li>I will access <strong>TempUser’s</strong> <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</strong> and do registry key creation, reading and deleting. </li>
</ol>
