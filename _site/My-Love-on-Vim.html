<meta name="description" content="My life with Vim  I started learning Vim during Aug, 2011, the original motivation was trying to &quot;get rid of my mouse while I am coding&quot;, I had no teacher but google, learnt it from the very hard way. From the beginning 2-3 months, honest speaking, I was less productive while using Vim comparing with IDEs, there were so many things I could do in second in IDE, for example: search/replace, formatting, re-factoring, folding, and so on, whereas I had to spent days in learning how to accomplish a simple task in Vim, that was really painful, but I never gave up!After the first two months of exploration, I was feeling much more comfortable in using Vim, and I believe I am going to use this king of text editor during rest of my life:).Reasons why lovingThere are millions of people love Vim during the past decades in the planet, there could be different reasons why people love Vim, I believe the ultimate reasons are:  Type less, do more!  Mouse-less!  Ultimate productivity!  Unlimited extensibility!I just want express my understanding on the last fact: Vim can be extended through Vim script, ruby, python, lua, any language you like, unlimited possibility, as long as you are doing something that many people are doing as well, there would be plugins to help you; there isn&#39;t?

It works with vim-snippets behind the scene to allow you to type very few characters but generates a usually used code snippet for you, with place-holders for you to easily customizing the snippet, this combination supports all mainstream languages as long as there are geeks speak it!

        <h2>My life with Vim</h2>
<p>
  I started learning Vim during Aug, 2011, the original motivation was trying to "get rid of my mouse while I am coding", I had no teacher but google, learnt it from the very hard way. From the beginning 2-3 months, honest speaking, I was less productive while using Vim comparing with IDEs, there were so many things I could do in second in IDE, for example: search/replace, formatting, re-factoring, folding, and so on, whereas I had to spent days in learning how to accomplish a simple task in Vim, that was really painful, but <b>I never gave up</b>!
After the first two months of exploration, I was feeling much more comfortable in using Vim, and I believe I am going to <b>use this king of text editor during rest of my life:)</b>.
</p>

<h2>Reasons why loving</h2>
<p>
There are millions of people love Vim during the past decades in the planet, there could be different reasons why people love Vim, I believe the ultimate reasons are:
</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul style="font-size: 16px;">
  <li><b>Type less, do more!</b></li>
  <li><b>Mouse-less!</b></li>
  <li><b>Ultimate productivity!</b></li>
  <li><b>Unlimited extensibility!</b></li>
</ul>

I just want express my understanding on the last fact: Vim can be extended through Vim script, ruby, python, lua, any language you like, unlimited possibility, as long as you are doing something that many people are doing as well, there would be plugins to help you; there isn't? You create one and benefits other people doing similar thing like you do!


<h2>Hacking with Vim technical talk</h2>
<p><iframe style="width: 760px; height: 480px; border: 1px solid #333;" src="http://wayneye.com/PPT/Hacking-With-Vim"></iframe></p>

</p>
<p>I did a technical talk to share my most favourite Vim tips to colleagues in Autodesk Singapore office, it was a short one, but with many ultimate and useful hacking tips with Vim, my intention was trying to excite people, let them open their mouth: "Wow! I never realized that Vim can do things like this!!", or "I did know Vim is powerful, I never expect it can be that powerful!!".</p>
<p>As I wish, I got some very positive feedback, and some familiar friends said they re-recognized me:)</p>


<h2>My favourite Vim tips</h2>
<p>
  The content below are the tips I demonstrated in my talk above, all of them are not my invention, but standing upon giant's shoulder! Since I will be using Vim in rest of my life, there is no doubt I about this point, and I wish I will contribute as much as I can to this god like text editor and its eco-system in the future!
</p>
<h3>Ultisnips + vim-snippets</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips" target="_blank">Ultisnips</a> boosts my coding speed like a rocket! It works with <a href="https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets" target="_blank">vim-snippets</a> behind the scene to allow you to type very few characters but generates a usually used code snippet for you, with place-holders for you to easily customizing the snippet, this combination supports all mainstream languages as long as there are geeks speak it! See my screenshot below:
</p>
<img src="https://semlfq.dm2301.livefilestore.com/y2pjM3n-igEDOIhyTZF_ZHcqnFix1kYiS0HKGyoR8Jqc0s3wMtJng7QtbYyiCPNU95EgWfk9VShiJ4K4MQqUvUSVMTu5RTs-WbpTYcPqEXYsdQ/vim-snips.gif?psid=1" alt="Vim-snippets">

<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultisnips is written in python and is more preferable comparing to the relatively old <a href="https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate" target="_blank">snipmate</a>, see discussion <a href="https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets/issues/363" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>If you couldn't find the language you want, for example <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/" target="_blank">Apple swift</a>, dude, it is a good opportunity for you to contribute:)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Dragging lines</h3>
<p>Dragging line(s) with automatically indentation fixing, this trick is accomplished by adding the following lines into vimrc:</p>
<pre>
  " Alt+j/k to move current line/selected lines up and down 
  nnoremap  :m+== 
  nnoremap  :m-2==
  inoremap  :m+==gi
  inoremap  :m-2==gi
  vnoremap  :m'&gt;+gv=gv
  vnoremap  :m-2gv=gv
</pre>

<p>It works for single line:<br>
<img src="https://semlfq.dm2301.livefilestore.com/y2p58ahCjSFl77PgNKlMoRLa5mzmETXy2MTElTByYN0LlrSj5YBvhxZwxOMLb4-qHEppFlKIM4ZXKkwo8VVChPOm7qIYnTD5qreVomrbonr0Qc/vim-drag-1.gif?psid=1" alt="Vim-drag-single-line" style="width: 720px">
</p>
<p>It works for multi lines:<br>
<img src="https://semlfq.dm2301.livefilestore.com/y2p2mYpyFQZB0Q3alZIxzRC3fgKzNacvrCjM7mCFagR7spzQOWJfuphOWYBMTiDk_1y4koWs89K9rnsIPDl54Oy6DqZMaTaRj6azxWGf2vDN_s/vim-drag-2.gif?psid=1" alt="Vim-drag-multi-lines">
</p>


<h3>Macros</h3>
<p>The JSON conversion I did during the technical session was accomplished by the following key combinations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>gg #Make sure current cursor is at the buffer beginning.</li>
  <li>qa # Start recording macros "a"</li>
  <li>i # Insert</li>
  <li>"</li>
  <li>f= #Forward to the char "="</li>
  <li>i" # Insert double quote before "="</li>
  <li>ESC #Back to normal mode</li>
  <li>l #Move to "="</li>
  <li>r: #Replace "=" with ":"</li>
  <li>a" #Append a double quote after ":"</li>
  <li>A", # Append " and , at the end of line</li>
  <li>j0 #Move to the beginning of the next line</li>
  <li>28@a #Repeat this operation for 28 times</li>
</ol>

<h3>Execute script inside Vim</h3>
<p>
  Every vimer knows we can execute script (shell, perl, python, ruby, js, just everything) right inside Vim without switching to terminal, although many people are tmux funs, I still prefer do it in Vim's way, by having the following lines in my vimrc, I can instantly run the current script and view the result with nearly no latency:)
</p>
<pre>
  autocmd FileType sh map <buffer> <c-s-e> :w<cr>:!/bin/sh % <cr>
  autocmd FileType ruby map <buffer> <c-s-e> :w<cr>:!/usr/bin/env ruby % <cr>
  autocmd FileType python map <buffer> <c-s-e> :w<cr>:!/usr/bin/env python % <cr>
  autocmd FileType javascript map <buffer> <c-s-e> :w<cr>:!/usr/bin/env node % <cr>
</cr></cr></c-s-e></buffer></cr></cr></c-s-e></buffer></cr></cr></c-s-e></buffer></cr></cr></c-s-e></buffer></pre>


<h3>Match &amp; Until</h3>
<p><code>cst</code> # <b>Change surround tag</b>, pretty useful when editing HTML</p>
<p><code>vit</code> # View in current tag</p>
<p><code>dit</code> # Delete content in current tag</p>
<p>f$ # Forward to the first occurrence of $ within current line</p>
<p>F$ # Backward to the first occurrence of $ within current line</p>
<p>dt$ # Delete content until matching the first occurrence of $ within current line</p>
<p>vt$ # View (Select) content until matching the first occurrence of $ within current line</p>
<h3>Search &amp; Replace</h3>
<p>Vim is extremely powerful in dealing with searching and replacing, the trick I've done in the session is just tip of the iceberg, I typed <b>:g/#/d</b> to remove all comments in a Ruby file.</p>
<h3>Vimium</h3>
<p>
  This is a awesome Chrome extension, the home page is: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en" target="_blank">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en</a>, suffering the internet without mouse is absolutely feasible!
</p>

<h3>My vimrc</h3>
<p><a href="http://WayneYe.com/vimrc" target="_blank">http://WayneYe.com/vimrc</a></p>

<h2>My future on Vim</h2>
<p>
  I have been using Vim everyday during the past 3 years, I never stopped learning it, and with no doubt, I will do so in rest of my life, really, <b>I just can't breath without it</b>! 
</p>
<p>
  There are absolutely a lot of improvement space for me, apart from continuously improve productivity, I have intention to do more things in vim: Email, highly customized snippets (refer: <a href="http://www.sirver.net/blog/2012/03/31/fourth-episode-of-ultisnips-screencast/" target='_blank"'>Ultisnips Screencast Episode 4</a>, presentation, and more important, I want to contribute to Vim ecosystem!

  WHEN YOU ARE OLD



  When you are old and grey and full of sleep, 
And nodding by the fire, take down this book, 
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look 
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep; 
How many loved your moments of glad grace, 
And loved your beauty with love false or true, 
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, 
And loved the sorrows of your changing face; 
And bending down beside the glowing bars, 
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled 
And paced upon the mountains overhead 
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.

In order to attend, I needed applying Ireland VISA, and since I was planning to fly back to Shanghai later in June, so I thought I could just fly from SF to Dublin, then Dublin to Shanghai, and soon I realized that there is no direct flight from DUB to PVG, so a practical (and also very fun and economic) option is to fly from Dublin to London, and then London to Shanghai, bingo ^_^
