My new development &amp; gaming machine - the later 2013 iMac!I wrote this blog post to record my thoughts and feelings before and after I purchased this baby:)My open questions and the answers I got from the Apple customer serviceI will choose a dedicated SSD, will it be PCIe based?Will the 2013 iMac easy to expand memory?

I admit I am a purist at this point, I don&#39;t want Windows slows down my precious SSD, so eventually I purchased a WesternDigital MyBook Pro USB 3.0 external drive, I didn&#39;t choose a cool ThunderBold disk because it is out of a loser&#39;s (穷屌 in Mandarin) budget.Why iMac instead of an ultimate PC/Workstation?There are two aspects: positive and negativeThings I like for iMacGorgeous 27 inch screenIncredibly fast (hardware) and&nbsp;stable (OSX)Instant warming up (I can put it there for one week, and can wake it up to work within a second)Developer friendly, built-in terminal, SSH, ruby, gcc, JavaScript support.Keyboard is the king!

<h3>My open questions and the answers I got from the Apple customer service</h3>
<ol>
<li>I will choose a dedicated SSD, will it be PCIe based?</li>
<li>Will the 2013 iMac easy to expand memory? Similar with the later 2012?</li>
<li>If I purchase the apple care in Singapore apple website online, will it valid in case in the future I migrated to other country (for example, USA) ?</li>
<li>Will the iMac pre-installed OSX mavericks?</li>
<li>If I buy a external USB 3.0 hard drive, do you think I can install a windows 8 on it?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Upgrade it in a money-saving manner!!</h3>
<h4>Memory</h4>
<p>Basic memory installed on the iMac is 8GB, if I choose to buy 16GB I gonna pay extra S$280 (approximate USD 224), according to my personality and habit of spending money, I will NOT do that! So does many other geeks: <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/mac/masterclass/?articleid=3418897" target="_blanl">How to install extra RAM memory in the new iMac</a>, actually installing extra memory for a 27 Inches iMac is fairly easy (while doing this on a 21.5 Inches iMac seems really scary, refer: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8Tuq373wPs">21.5-inch iMac Late 2012 Memory Installation Video</a>, I am afraid of doing it^_^), so eventually I purchased a pair of Crucial: 8GB * 2, so I totally got 24GB.</p>
<h4>Hard disk</h4>
<p>The built-in 256GB SSD is my choice!

<h3>Why iMac instead of an ultimate PC/Workstation?</h3>
<p>There are two aspects: positive and negative<img style="background-image: url('http://wayneye.com/Images/winLiveEmotions.gif'); background-position: -0px -0px; width: 19px; height: 19px;" alt="Smile" src="http://wayneye.com/Images/invis.gif"></p>
<h4>Things I like for iMac</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gorgeous 27 inch screen</li>
<li>Incredibly fast (hardware) and stable (OSX)</li>
<li>Instant warming up (I can put it there for one week, and can wake it up to work within a second)</li>
<li>Developer friendly, built-in terminal, SSH, ruby, gcc, JavaScript support.</li>
<li>Keyboard is the king! I can achieve 80% of my work mouse less!</li>
<li>Wonderful ecosystem: homebrew, QuickSilver, MacVim, iPhoto, iTunes, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Things I don't like for a Windows PC</h4>
<li>Slow, I wonder most NT developers were developing based on high performance SSD...Win XP &gt; Windows 7 &gt; Windows 8 &gt; Windows 8.1</li>
<li>Unstable: blue screen? A few times. Unresponsive UI? Several times! Slow response when I am typing? All the time...</li>
<li>Much slower after 3 months...Much slower if it was kept running for several days.</li>
<li>There is no way to use it without mouse...</li>

  SkyJump Las Vegas holds the Guinness World Record for highest commercial decelerator descent with an official height of 829 ft (253 m) and is located at Stratosphere Las Vegas. As part of its grand opening event, Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman presented a written proclamation deeming April 20, 2010 as SkyJump Day in Las Vegas.

Overall during my week staying my daily schedule was listening to sessions mixed with slack/emails during the daylight, and party/social in the evening time.

All the keynotes/sessions have been uploaded here:  https://reinvent.awsevents.com/learn/keynotes/  and all announcements were summarized at this page, my personal top 5 thrilled announcement...</p>

  WHEN YOU ARE OLD



  When you are old and grey and full of sleep, 
And nodding by the fire, take down this book, 
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look 
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep; 
How many loved your moments of glad grace, 
And loved your beauty with love false or true, 
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, 
And loved the sorrows of your changing face; 
And bending down beside the glowing bars, 
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled 
And paced upon the mountains overhead 
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars. 
– By William Butler Yeats

I was planning to attend #adskfootball2019 in Dublin, Ireland from Jun 14th to Jun 16th, 2019:

    
    Autodesk Football Tournament 2019


In order to attend, I needed applying Ireland VISA, and since I was planning to fly back to Shanghai later in June, so I thought I could just fly from SF to Dublin, then Dublin to Shanghai, and soon I realized that there is no direct flight from DUB to PVG, so a practical (and also very fun and economic) option is to fly from Dublin to London, and then London to Shanghai, bingo ^_^
