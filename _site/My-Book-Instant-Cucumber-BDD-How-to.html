<meta name="description" content="The backgroundI received an email during November 2012 from Packt, in the email they asked me whether or not consider writing a book for them related with BDD using Cucumber based on Rails platform, the book will only contains 50-70 pages, they named this kind of book &quot;Instant book&quot;, usually it is a quick guide for beginners using some kinds of technologies. Well, my first reaction was: &quot;Wow, I even never thought about writing a book, if I am going to write one, hum... can I?&quot;, I did suspect myself a little bit, especially, the book will be written in English, I admitted I was not confident enough to reply them.Actually I could imagine how hard this would be for me, a rookie who would write his first book, and at that period I was about to finish my 6 months business trip in Xi&#39;an and would be back to ThoughtWorks Shanghai office soon, additionally, my son was just reaching two years old, too many things... However, I am kind of person who always expects challenges, and always willing to improve and beyond myself! I decided to give it a try!">

          <h3>The background</h3>
<p>I received an email during November 2012 from <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/" target="_blank">Packt</a>, in the email they asked me whether or not consider writing a book for them related with BDD using Cucumber based on Rails platform, the book will only contains 50-70 pages, they named this kind of book "Instant book", usually it is a quick guide for beginners using some kinds of technologies. Well, my first reaction was: "Wow, I even never thought about writing a book, if I am going to write one, hum... can I?", I did suspect myself a little bit, especially, <strong>the book will be written in English</strong>, I admitted I was not confident enough to reply them.</p>
<p>Actually I could imagine how hard this would be for me, a rookie who would write his first book, and at that period I was about to finish my 6 months business trip in Xi'an and would be back to ThoughtWorks Shanghai office soon, additionally, my son was just reaching two years old, too many things... However, I am kind of person who always expects challenges, and always willing to <strong>improve and beyond myself</strong>! I decided to give it a try!</p>

<h3>The process</h3>
<p>As soon as replied their email, the game kicked off, and I soon felt the pressure, Packt asked me to give them a skeleton of the book within three days, whereas 95% of my daily work was pair programming, and the rest 5% was meeting:) I had no choice but utilizing all my spare time, and I need my family's support, especially my son's support:)</p>
<p>I worked out a skeleton and sent to Packt in time, I decided to write this book with not only easy guidance and tutorials, but also with technical explanation in depth!</p>
<p>
  I decided to use my free <a href="https://bitbucket.org" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> git repository to store my book, the drafted skeleton was submitted by me on <i>Dec 07 2012</i>, there had been many changes after the final publish, but this was really the first step!

  WHEN YOU ARE OLD



  When you are old and grey and full of sleep, 
And nodding by the fire, take down this book, 
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look 
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep; 
How many loved your moments of glad grace, 
And loved your beauty with love false or true, 
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, 
And loved the sorrows of your changing face; 
And bending down beside the glowing bars, 
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled 
And paced upon the mountains overhead 
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars. 
– By William Butler Yeats

I was planning to attend #adskfootball2019 in Dublin, Ireland from Jun 14th to Jun 16th, 2019:

    
    Autodesk Football Tournament 2019


In order to attend, I needed applying Ireland VISA, and since I was planning to fly back to Shanghai later in June, so I thought I could just fly from SF to Dublin, then Dublin to Shanghai, and soon I realized that there is no direct flight from DUB to PVG, so a practical (and also very fun and economic) option is to fly from Dublin to London, and then London to Shanghai, bingo ^_^
