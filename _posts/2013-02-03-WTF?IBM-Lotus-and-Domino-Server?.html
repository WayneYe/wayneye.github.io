<p>Assume we are now in <b>Jurassic period</b>, the technologies above are in <b>Cambrian period</b>, developers who has less than 4 years experience probably never heard about any of the above terminologies... No choice, I was dealing with them during the passes few weeks, I met ODBC as soon as I graduated while I was development ASP website using VBScript, but it was soon replaced by ADO, and after half a year I started studying .NET so I used ADO.NET, nowadays we usually talk to Entity Framework which abstracts ADO.NET interfaces...

<ul>
<li>IDE crash
<p>Yes, it crashes without symptom, especially when I enabled debug, when crash happens, or windows running on the same process - "notes2.exe" crashes, it SUCKS!</p>

</ul>
