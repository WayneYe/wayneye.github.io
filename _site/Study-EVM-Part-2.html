        <p>Once the CPI/SPI were calculated at some time-stamp, project manager should be deeper analyses, he need to predict the future cost:</p>

<p><strong>ETC (Estimate To Completion)</strong></p>

<p>Then EAC (Estimate At Completion) = AC + ETC</p>

<p>How to calculate ETC based on current situation (EV/AC/PV and SPI&amp;CPI), there are usually three methods:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Regardless of current Schedule/Cost Performance Index
      <br></strong>This way is simple, I don’t care what’s happened, <strong>EAC = BAC + EAC – AC</strong>, in other words, project team is confident to finish the project below estimated cost. </li>

  <li>
<strong>Estimated based on current CPI
      <br></strong>This way is straight-forward, review current CPI and estimate future cost based on it:

    <br><strong>EAC = AC + (BAC -EV)/CPI = BAC / CPI
      <br></strong>
</li>

  <li>
<strong>Consider both CPI/SPI impact</strong>

    <br>I think this way the rationalist one, it consider both SPI and CPI, in additional, PM could give a “<strong>weight</strong>” to SPI or CPI according to his/her experience and judgement, so the formula is:

    <br><strong>EAC  = (BAC – EV) / (CPI * SPI)</strong>
</li>
</ol>

<p>No matter which method PM chooses, as long as the calculated/predicted <strong>EAC is not acceptable</strong>, then it is an “<strong>early warning</strong>” to the team.</p>

<p>Even more, PM need calculate TCPI, the content below as copied from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_value_management">EVM on Wikipedia</a>, it is very clear for me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The To Complete Performance Index (TCPI) provides a projection of the anticipated performance required to achieve either the BAC or the EAC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the TCPI based on BAC (describing the performance required to meet the original BAC budgeted total):<img style="background-color: white;" class="BlogImage" alt="TCPI_{BAC} = { BAC - EV \over BAC - AC }" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/5/d/55d902909bba737fe762d4a0e08f3680.png"></p>

<p>or for the TCPI based on EAC (describing the performance required to meet a new, revised budget total EAC):
<img style="background-color: white;" class="BlogImage" alt="TCPI_{EAC} = { BAC - EV \over EAC - AC }" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/f/9/4/f9464ad8d231f1068009c1098d57f2b2.png"></p>

<p><strong>Independent estimate at completion (IEAC)</strong></p>

<p>The IEAC is a metric to project total cost using the performance to date to project overall performance. This can be compared to the EAC, which is the manager’s projection.</p>
<img style="background-color: white;" class="BlogImage" alt="IEAC = \sum AC + { \left( BAC - \sum EV \right) \over CPI }" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/4/9/b49bab309431a0deb8d34096a5c146e2.png">

I bought a 2015 BMW X5 Dec last year, it has been half a year so far (with 2 months she stayed inside the garage for most of the time due to the pandemic), I am pretty satisfied with it, her condition is absolutely excellent, everything works, yes you see it correctly, after 5 years of its life, there was nothing broken, as BMW vehicle built in recent years, this is something not VERY easy.  My plan is to keep it as long as possible before it turns into an endless money pit, and keeping her value as high as possible, one of the major reason I b...</p>

  SkyJump Las Vegas holds the Guinness World Record for highest commercial decelerator descent with an official height of 829 ft (253 m) and is located at Stratosphere Las Vegas. As part of its grand opening event, Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman presented a written proclamation deeming April 20, 2010 as SkyJump Day in Las Vegas.

    Crazy crowd at midnight madness party


Overall during my week staying my daily schedule was listening to sessions mixed with slack/emails during the daylight, and party/social in the evening time.

All the keynotes/sessions have been uploaded here:  https://reinvent.awsevents.com/learn/keynotes/  and all announcements were summarized at this page, my personal top 5 thrilled announcement...</p>

  WHEN YOU ARE OLD



  When you are old and grey and full of sleep, 
And nodding by the fire, take down this book, 
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look 
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep; 
How many loved your moments of glad grace, 
And loved your beauty with love false or true, 
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you, 
And loved the sorrows of your changing face; 
And bending down beside the glowing bars, 
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled 
And paced upon the mountains overhead 
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars. 
– By William Butler Yeats
