<p><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />Hooray! My new development &amp; gaming machine - <strong>the later 2013 iMac</strong>!</p>
<p>I wrote this blog post to record my thoughts and feelings before and after I purchased this baby:)</p>
<h3>My open questions and the answers I got from the Apple customer service</h3>
<ol>
<li>I will choose a dedicated SSD, will it be PCIe based?</li>
<li>Will the 2013 iMac easy to expand memory? Similar with the later 2012?</li>
<li>If I purchase the apple care in Singapore apple website online, will it valid in case in the future I migrated to other country (for example, USA) ?</li>
<li>Will the iMac pre-installed OSX mavericks?</li>
<li>If I buy a external USB 3.0 hard drive, do you think I can install a windows 8 on it?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Upgrade it in a money-saving manner!!</h3>
<h4>Memory</h4>
<p>Basic memory installed on the iMac is 8GB, if I choose to buy 16GB I gonna pay extra S$280 (approximate USD 224), according to my personality and habit of spending money, I will NOT do that! So does many other geeks: <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/mac/masterclass/?articleid=3418897" target="_blanl">How to install extra RAM memory in the new iMac</a>, actually installing extra memory for a 27 Inches iMac is fairly easy (while doing this on a 21.5 Inches iMac seems really scary, refer: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8Tuq373wPs">21.5-inch iMac Late 2012 Memory Installation Video</a>, I am afraid of doing it^_^), so eventually I purchased a pair of Crucial: 8GB * 2, so I totally got 24GB.</p>
<h4>Hard disk</h4>
<p>The built-in 256GB SSD is my choice! I didn't choose the fusion drive (1TB HDD with built-in 128G SSD), because I want best performance<img style="background-image: url('/assets/images/winLiveEmotions.gif'); background-position: -0px -0px; width: 19px; height: 19px;" alt="Smile" src="/assets/images/invis.gif" />; but I do need install Windows for .Net Development and gaming? I admit I am a purist at this point, I don't want Windows slows down my precious SSD, so eventually I purchased a WesternDigital MyBook Pro USB 3.0 external drive, I didn't choose a cool <a href="http://www.apple.com/thunderbolt/" target="_blank">ThunderBold</a> disk because it is out of a poor man's (穷屌 in Mandarin) budget<img style="background-image: url('/assets/images/winLiveEmotions.gif'); background-position: -0px -0px; width: 19px; height: 19px;" alt="Smile" src="/assets/images/invis.gif" />.</p>
<h3>Why iMac instead of an ultimate PC/Workstation?</h3>
<p>There are two aspects: positive and negative<img style="background-image: url('/assets/images/winLiveEmotions.gif'); background-position: -0px -0px; width: 19px; height: 19px;" alt="Smile" src="/assets/images/invis.gif" /></p>
<h4>Things I like for iMac</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gorgeous 27 inch screen</li>
<li>Incredibly fast (hardware) and&nbsp;stable (OSX)</li>
<li>Instant warming up (I can put it there for one week, and can wake it up to work within a second)</li>
<li>Developer friendly, built-in terminal, SSH, ruby, gcc, JavaScript support.</li>
<li>Keyboard is the king! I can achieve 80% of my work mouse less!</li>
<li>Wonderful ecosystem: homebrew, QuickSilver, MacVim, iPhoto, iTunes, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Things I don't like for a Windows PC</h4>
<li>Slow, I wonder most NT developers were developing based on high performance SSD...Win XP &gt; Windows 7 &gt; Windows 8 &gt; Windows 8.1</li>
<li>Unstable: blue screen? A few times. Unresponsive UI? Several times! Slow response when I am typing? All the time...</li>
<li>Much slower after 3 months...Much slower if it was kept running for several days.</li>
<li>There is no way to use it without mouse...</li>
<h3>The final configuration and the invoice</h3>

</p>
<p>Daily tech website describes the 2013 iMac's price is <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Apple+Unleashes+Aggressively+Priced+Haswell+iMacs/article33440.htm">aggressive</a>, IMHO, it worths the price!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I love it very much! As I expected, it is deadly fast, super stable and reliable, instant warming up; When I am coding on it, I feel I am a genious who can solve problems with easy; When I am gaming on it, I enjoy and splendid image quality and ultimate performance!</p>

  Updated Nov 28th, I sold the original keyboard/mouse at S$120, because I prefer to use my Cherry mechanical keyboard and gaming mouse<img style="background-image: url('/assets/images/winLiveEmotions.gif'); background-position: -0px -0px; width: 19px; height: 19px;" alt="Smile" src="/assets/images/invis.gif" />.
