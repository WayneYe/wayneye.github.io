<meta name="description" content="My Life Inside the AI EraWe are living in an explosive AI era. Without a doubt, AI is reshaping everything around us — how we learn, work, communicate, and build. It is impossible to ignore: AI now answers our questions, helps us make decisions, assists us in coding, organizes our lives, and guides us through complex topics that used to require months, even years of experience to crack.Over the past two+ years, I have used AI every single hour — yes, literally every hour — whether on my computer or my phone. It has become both a companion and an accelerator in my life. But more importantly, it has reshaped how I think and how I learn.This is my personal reflection on how AI has shaped me, and how I believe we should approach this new force that is transforming the world.How AI Shapes My daily life  Coding: As a software engineer, no doubt coding is my top usage scenario: from auto-completing as I type, generating code snippet as I prompted, to understand a large size codebase, refactoring/improving existing code, etc.  Learning: System design, best practices, quickly learning something I am not familiar (istio, Kafka, AWS EKS CNI, EAP protocol…); how to build up home servers, arrs,  all linux related knowledge, I knew then I will know much deeper, or I don’t know then now I know.  Life questions: all sorts of random question: how and when to plant radish/pepper😀, cooking tips, what is this (air switch on the wall, random electronics…) kinda questions.  Stock &amp; investment decisions: yes, I asked AI to analyze a domain, an individual company, financial data like PEG, DCF evaluation, potential momentum and risk(s), etc (disclaimer: AI is not financial advice — I always verify numbers independently)AI has truly boosted my learning, working productivity, I’d like to say: “it installed multiple wings to our human beings, we can now fly in the knowledge sky!”My Attitude Toward AI  AI essentially lowered the learning cost for everybody, the easy and fast access to knowledge/skills/experience is UNPRECEDENTED!  Treat AI as your learning advisor and companion, using it wisely to dramatically improve learning efficiency!  Never 100% trust AI, ask it to provide reliable proof, sometimes it will admit “I was wrong about XYZ… blah blah”Different ways of using AI  AI as a teacher (explains concepts at any level)  AI as a pair-programmer (debugging, code review)  AI as a research assistant (summaries, comparisons)  AI as a brainstorm partner (ideas, creativity, writing)  AI as a life coach (habit prompts, rational thinking)When to trust AI  Rough drafts  Brainstorming  Learning summaries/TLDRs  Explaining difficult concepts  Code patternsWhen NOT to trust AI  Legal/financial/medical decisions  Unverified facts or citations  Anything involving risk, security, or critical systems  Sensitive personal opinionsFuture Outlook — What’s Next?At the end of the day, AI didn’t replace me — it amplified me. It made me learn faster, think deeper, and build more.I am NOT worried about massive jobs replacement by AI, nor worries about layingoffs; instead, I deeply believe in AI will end up create MUCH more jobs!
