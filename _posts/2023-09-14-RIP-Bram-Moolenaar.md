From the most recent [MacVim release note](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/releases/tag/release-178):
> As some of you may have read, Bram Moolenaar, the creator and maintainer of Vim, has passed away recently. He has worked tirelessly on Vim for more than 30 years and this release is dedicated to him. If you would like, you could pay your respects at this discussion thread.

> The Vim project has transitioned to new maintainers, and MacVim will continue to be supported as long as Vim is around.

I decided to use Vim as my all time text editor [since 12 years ago](https://wayneye.site/My-Love-on-Vim), it completely changed my mind and my life, there were some times I felt like my typing faster then my thinking.  Mr Bram has all my respect, he will be badly missed!  RIP
