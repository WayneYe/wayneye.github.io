I didn&#39;t choose the fusion drive (1TB HDD with built-in 128G SSD), because I want best performance; but I do need install Windows for .Net Development and gaming? I admit I am a purist at this point, I don&#39;t want Windows slows down my precious SSD, so eventually I purchased a WesternDigital MyBook Pro USB 3.0 external drive, I didn&#39;t choose a cool ThunderBold disk because it is out of a poor man&#39;s (穷屌 in Mandarin) budget.

I admit I am a purist at this point, I don't want Windows slows down my precious SSD, so eventually I purchased a WesternDigital MyBook Pro USB 3.0 external drive, I didn't choose a cool <a href="http://www.apple.com/thunderbolt/" target="_blank">ThunderBold</a> disk because it is out of a poor man's (穷屌 in Mandarin) budget<img style="background-image: url('/assets/images/winLiveEmotions.gif'); background-position: -0px -0px; width: 19px; height: 19px;" alt="Smile" src="/assets/images/invis.gif" />.</p>
<h3>Why iMac instead of an ultimate PC/Workstation?</h3>
<p>There are two aspects: positive and negative<img style="background-image: url('/assets/images/winLiveEmotions.gif'); background-position: -0px -0px; width: 19px; height: 19px;" alt="Smile" src="/assets/images/invis.gif" /></p>
<h4>Things I like for iMac</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gorgeous 27 inch screen</li>
<li>Incredibly fast (hardware) and&nbsp;stable (OSX)</li>
<li>Instant warming up (I can put it there for one week, and can wake it up to work within a second)</li>
<li>Developer friendly, built-in terminal, SSH, ruby, gcc, JavaScript support.</li>
<li>Keyboard is the king! I can achieve 80% of my work mouse less!</li>
<li>Wonderful ecosystem: homebrew, QuickSilver, MacVim, iPhoto, iTunes, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Things I don't like for a Windows PC</h4>
<li>Slow, I wonder most NT developers were developing based on high performance SSD...Win XP &gt; Windows 7 &gt; Windows 8 &gt; Windows 8.1</li>
<li>Unstable: blue screen? A few times. Unresponsive UI? Several times! Slow response when I am typing? All the time...</li>
<li>Much slower after 3 months...Much slower if it was kept running for several days.</li>
<li>There is no way to use it without mouse...</li>
<h3>The final configuration and the invoice</h3>

</p>
<p>Daily tech website describes the 2013 iMac's price is <a href="http://www.dailytech.com/Apple+Unleashes+Aggressively+Priced+Haswell+iMacs/article33440.htm">aggressive</a>, IMHO, it worths the price!</p>
<h3>Working with it</h3>
<p>

</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I love it very much! As I expected, it is deadly fast, super stable and reliable, instant warming up; When I am coding on it, I feel I am a genious who can solve problems with easy; When I am gaming on it, I enjoy and splendid image quality and ultimate performance!</p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 16pt">It is just awesome!</strong></p>

  Updated Nov 28th, I sold the original keyboard/mouse at S$120, because I prefer to use my Cherry mechanical keyboard and gaming mouse<img style="background-image: url('/assets/images/winLiveEmotions.gif'); background-position: -0px -0px; width: 19px; height: 19px;" alt="Smile" src="/assets/images/invis.gif" />.
