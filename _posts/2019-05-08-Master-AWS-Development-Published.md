## The motivation

In June 2018, PacktPub contacted me and asked my interest for recording a video course, they provided a few topics like AWS, Python, Docker, etc, I knew it could be very challenging but also pretty cool thing to do, so I accepted their invitation without hesitation.

## The journey
Nothing begins easily, I actually struggled quite a few weeks on the audio quality.  My collaborator [Ranjitap Panda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ranjita-panda-85737b12b/) suggested me to buy [this Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-Microphone-Brushed-Aluminum/dp/B002OO333Q/ref=sr_1_7?crid=MFDYMJ898LW7&keywords=blue+microphone&qid=1558027821&s=gateway&sprefix=blue+micro%2Caps%2C197&sr=8-7), I did and it was very good, however, my working room isn't quite soundproof, so she suggested me to buy something like [this](https://express.google.com/u/0/product/14999533088633590141_483183884403381036_5916206?utm_source=google_shopping&utm_medium=tu_prop&utm_content=eid-lsjeuxoeqt&gtim=CPCPwdrs3baPKhD67br-_fi4isQBGPCz2hkiA1VTRCiQ-cHnBTCujOkC&utm_campaign=5916206&gclid=CjwKCAjwlPTmBRBoEiwAHqpvhR80piK0OZcxPrMsLaqS39LvCaCDl9RBX4S9SwsibW1LTSZKIm6B1hoCpr8QAvD_BwE) to improve the quality, well, I looked at it and I wasn't that convinced by its effectiveness :sweat_smile:.

I decided to DIY a super proffessional "recording studio", it wasn't so hard after 2 days of hand making:
![Studio-1]({{site.url}}/Image/Studio-1.jpg "Studio-1")
![Studio-2]({{site.url}}/Image/Studio-2.jpg "Studio-2")

This is cool, isn't it :smile:, most important, it is free and fun!!
